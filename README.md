Meet Legacy , a game that’s all about, well, I’m not sure what it’s all about yet. What I do know, is when it’s feature complete (v.1.0.0) it will be awesome. So! What is this game really? First things first, this is not some, yet another pointless clone of yet another pointless clone of yet another pointless application. Colonial is meant to be a complete rethink of Real Time Strategy.(RTS) Instead of building some empire till you have a ton of artillery and crushing other empires,
you will build a small colony until you can expand to form a new one, creating a clan. After you create a certain number of clans, you will form a tribe. When your tribe controls all the available territory on your world, you can move on to another one, and so on. In other words, the game never really “ends”, but, there will be goals, such as reaching a set level within a set time, controlling a certain amount of territory, and reaching a certain level of prestige. As the game is still in planning stages (code can flexibly be rewritten), many details have yet to be formulated. Consider this a change to rethink the way you game, and develop games.
I guess I can’t really write a good into so here are some basics:
You will start off with a simple
colony of creatures (as yet,
unnamed).
These include a King, a Queen,
some Warriors, and workers (we’ll
give them proper names and
classes as we go, sorting them out
into a complex system).
Your goal will be to feed your
growing workers and warriors,
explore the inside of the den, and
upgrade your workers to the next
level.
Once your workers are upgraded,
you will be able to start doing
some interesting things (we’ll work
those out), and eventually upgrade
your colony to the next level.
Each level will bring improvements,
such as new abilities, or changes to
the hitpoints, attack points, brain
power, food requirements, etc.
Each time you upgrade your King
will become a little more free to
roam (he’s defending the Queen at
the start).
The King will be able to leave in
level 3, and the queen will be able
to move around (this might
change)
Eventually, you will get drones,
soldiers, gatherers, war drones,
juggernauts, and a range of other
assorted creatures.
